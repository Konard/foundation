* Alpine / musl is not supported, because our test suite is failing due to bugs and missing features in musl libc.
* NetBSD and OpenBSD are in a similar state as Alpine: no stable buildbot and AFAIK tests are failing
* Android is no longer actively maintained
* Cygwin and MinGW are officially unsupported, see bpo-45537 and bpo-45538

..

Esp. Android and possibly iOS are platforms which Python should be targeting in the future, since the story for Python on those platforms currently is pretty.

..

The policy Brett is proposing just makes that explicit and gives us something to point to when someone comes up with a patch to support PDP-11 or when someone's patch for Android breaks Windows.  I don't think we'll wind up with tier support police; if a core dev wants to take responsibility for a patch for a platform that is not tier 3 or above they can still do that, but if it breaks things for a supported platform it will be reverted.

..

E.g. Android support was even funded by the PSF recently. Why would we want to remove that support from the code base again, just because we don't have a core dev maintaining it ?
Also note that the stdlib does in fact support other Python implementations reusing (parts of) it, e.g. Jython, PyPy and IronPython. Again, without core devs backing these.

**Python** is a [high-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language), [general-purpose programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/general-purpose_programming_language). Its design philosophy emphasizes [code readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/code_readability) with the use of [significant indentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/off-side_rule).<ref name#"AutoNT-7"/>

Python is [dynamically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_system#DYNAMIC) and [garbage-collected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/garbage_collection_(computer_science)). It supports multiple [programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/programming_paradigm)s, including [structured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/structured_programming) (particularly [procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/procedural_programming)), [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/object-oriented_programming) and [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/functional_programming). It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive [standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/standard_library).<ref name#"About"/><ref>{{Cite web|title#PEP 206 – Python Advanced Library|url#https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/|url-status#live|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20210505003659/https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0206/|archive-date#5 May 2021|access-date#11 October 2021|website#Python.org}}</ref>

{{Main|History of Python}}

Python was invented in the late 1980s<ref name#"venners-interview-pt-1"/> by [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrum_Wiskunde_&_Informatica) (CWI) in the [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands) as a successor to the [ABC programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)), which was inspired by [SETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETL),<ref name#"AutoNT-12"/> capable of [exception handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exception_handling) and interfacing with the [Amoeba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoeba_(operating_system)) operating system.<ref name#"faq-created"/> Its implementation began in December&nbsp;1989.<ref name#"timeline-of-python"/> Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "[benevolent dictator for life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benevolent_dictator_for_life)" (BDFL), a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker<ref name#"lj-bdfl-resignation"/> (he's since come out of retirement and is self-titled "BDFL-emeritus"<!-- on his Twitter-->).

{{As of|2023|10|post#,}} Python 3.12 is the stable release, and 3.12 and 3.11 are the only versions with active (as opposed to just security) support. Notable changes in 3.11 from 3.10 include increased program execution speed and improved error reporting.<ref>{{Cite web |title#Python 3.11 released [LWN.net] |author#corbet |work#lwn.net |date#24 October 2022 |access-date#15 November 2022 |url# https://lwn.net/Articles/912216/}}</ref>

Every Python release since 3.5 has added some syntax to the language. 3.10 added the <code>|</code> union type operator <ref>{{cite web | url#https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-union | title#Built-in Types }}</ref> and the <code>match</code> and <code>case</code> keywords (for structural [pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pattern_matching) statements). 3.11 expanded [exception handling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exception_handling_(programming)) functionality. Python 3.12 added the new keyword <code>type</code>.

Python 3.11 claims to be between 10 and 60% faster than Python 3.10, and Python 3.12 adds another 5% on top of that. It also has improved error messages, and many other changes.

{{As of|2023|June|27|since#y}}, Python 3.8 is the oldest supported version of Python (albeit in the 'security support' phase), due to Python 3.7 reaching [end-of-life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/end-of-life_product).<ref>{{Cite web |date#2023-08-10 |title#Python |url#https://endoflife.date/python |access-date#2023-08-15 |website#endoflife.date |language#en-US |archive-date#18 September 2021 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20210918162455/https://endoflife.date/python |url-status#live}}</ref>

##Design philosophy and features##
Python is a [multi-paradigm programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multi-paradigm_programming_language). [Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and [structured programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/structured_programming) are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and [aspect-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aspect-oriented_programming) (including [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metaprogramming)<ref name#"AutoNT-13"/> and [metaobject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metaobject)s).<ref name#"AutoNT-14"/> Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including [design by contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/design_by_contract)<ref name#"AutoNT-15"/><ref name#"AutoNT-16"/> and [logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logic_programming).<ref name#"AutoNT-17"/>

Python uses [dynamic typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dynamic_typing) and a combination of [reference counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reference_counting) and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for [memory management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/memory_management).<ref name#"Reference_counting">{{Cite web |url#https://docs.python.org/extending/extending.html#reference-counts |title#Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter: Reference Counts |publisher#Docs.python.org |language#en |access-date#5 June 2020 |quote#Since Python makes heavy use of <code>malloc()</code> and <code>free()</code>, it needs a strategy to avoid memory leaks as well as the use of freed memory. The chosen method is called *reference counting*. |archive-date#18 October 2012 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20121018063230/http://docs.python.org/extending/extending.html#reference-counts |url-status#live}}</ref> It uses dynamic [name resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_resolution_(programming_languages)) ([late binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/late_binding)), which binds method and variable names during program execution.

Its design offers some support for functional programming in the [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) tradition. It has {{codes|filter|map|reduce|d#and}} functions; [list comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_comprehension)s, [dictionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array), sets, and [generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generator_(computer_programming)) expressions.<ref name#"AutoNT-59"/> The standard library has two modules ({{codes|itertools}} and {{codes|functools}}) that implement functional tools borrowed from [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell) and [Standard ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML).<ref name#"AutoNT-18"/>

Its core philosophy is summarized in the [Zen of Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python) (PEP 20), which includes [aphorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aphorism)s such as:<ref name#"PEP20"/>
<!-- Note this isn't a full list, just some of the more significant aphorisms -->
* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Readability counts.

However, Python features regularly violate these principles and received criticism for adding unnecessary language bloat.<ref name#"Python-Changes-2014">{{cite web |url#https://learning-python.com/python-changes-2014-plus.html |title#Python Changes 2014+ |last#Lutz |first#Mark |date#January 2022 |website#Learning Python |access-date#2024-02-25 |archive-date#15 March 2024 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20240315075935/https://learning-python.com/python-changes-2014-plus.html |url-status#live}}</ref><ref name#"Python-is-not-a-great-programming-language">{{cite web |url#https://gist.github.com/RobertAKARobin/a1cba47d62c009a378121398cc5477ea |title#Python is not a great programming language |last#Thomas |first#Robin |date#2023-05-03 |website#GitHub Gist |access-date#2024-02-25 |archive-date#31 December 2023 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20231231092949/https://gist.github.com/RobertAKARobin/a1cba47d62c009a378121398cc5477ea |url-status#live}}</ref> Responses to these criticisms are that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule.<ref name#"Confusion-regarding-a-rule-in-the-Zen-of-Python">{{cite web |url#https://discuss.python.org/t/confusion-regarding-a-rule-in-the-zen-of-python/15927 |title#Confusion regarding a rule in The Zen of Python |author#<!--Not stated--> |date#2022-05-03 |website#Python Help - Discussions on Python.org |access-date#2024-02-25 |archive-date#25 February 2024 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20240225221142/https://discuss.python.org/t/confusion-regarding-a-rule-in-the-zen-of-python/15927 |url-status#live}}</ref> The addition of some new features had been so controversial that Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life following vitriol over the addition of the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8.<ref name#"The-Most-Controversial-Python-Walrus-Operator">{{cite web |url#https://pythonsimplified.com/the-most-controversial-python-walrus-operator/ |title#The Most Controversial Python Walrus Operator |last#Ambi |first#Chetan |date#2021-07-04 |website#Python Simplified |access-date#2024-02-05 |archive-date#27 August 2023 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20230827154931/https://pythonsimplified.com/the-most-controversial-python-walrus-operator/ |url-status#live}}</ref><ref name#"The-Controversy-Behind-The-Walrus-Operator-in-Python">{{cite web |url#https://therenegadecoder.com/code/the-controversy-behind-the-walrus-operator-in-python/ |title#The Controversy Behind The Walrus Operator in Python |last#Grifski |first#Jeremy |date#2020-05-24 |website#The Renegade Coder |access-date#2024-02-25 |archive-date#28 December 2023 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20231228135749/https://therenegadecoder.com/code/the-controversy-behind-the-walrus-operator-in-python/ |url-status#live}}</ref>

Nevertheless, rather than building all of its functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly [extensible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensibility) via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with [ABC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)), which espoused the opposite approach.<ref name#"venners-interview-pt-1"/>

Python claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. In contrast to [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl)'s "[there is more than one way to do it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/there_is_more_than_one_way_to_do_it)" motto, Python embraces a "there should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it."<!-- the "—" spacing here, although inconsistent with Wikipedia MOS, is quoted text and must be maintained as is; do not "correct" it --> philosophy.<ref name#"PEP20"/> In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve the same task. There are, for example, at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use.<ref name#"Python-String-Formatting-Best-Practices">{{cite web |url#https://realpython.com/python-string-formatting/ |title#Python String Formatting Best Practices |last#Bader |first#Dan |website#Real Python |access-date#2024-02-25 |archive-date#18 February 2024 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20240218083506/https://realpython.com/python-string-formatting/ |url-status#live}}</ref> [Alex Martelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Martelli), a [Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow) at the [Python Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation) and Python book author, wrote: "To describe something as 'clever' is *not* considered a compliment in the Python culture."<ref name#"AutoNT-19"/>

Python's developers usually strive to avoid [premature optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/premature_optimization) and reject patches to non-critical parts of the [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython) reference implementation that would offer marginal increases in speed at the cost of clarity.<ref name#"AutoNT-20"/> Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using a [just-in-time compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/just-in-time_compilation) like [PyPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyPy). It is also possible to [cross-compile to other languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#Cross-compilers_to_other_languages), but it either doesn't provide the full speed-up that might be expected, since Python is a very dynamic language, or a restricted subset of Python is compiled, and possibly semantics are slightly changed.<ref name#PyJL/>

Python's developers aim for it to be fun to use. This is reflected in its name—a tribute to the British comedy group [Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python)<ref name#"whyname"/>—and in occasionally playful approaches to tutorials and reference materials, such as the use of the terms "spam" and "eggs" (a reference to [a Monty Python sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(Monty_Python))) in examples, instead of the often-used ["foo" and "bar"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foobar).<ref>{{Cite web|url#https://insidetech.monster.com/training/articles/8114-15-ways-python-is-a-powerful-force-on-the-web|title#15 Ways Python Is a Powerful Force on the Web|access-date#3 July 2018|archive-date#11 May 2019|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20190511065650/http://insidetech.monster.com/training/articles/8114-15-ways-python-is-a-powerful-force-on-the-web|url-status#dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title#pprint – Data pretty printer – Python 3.11.0 documentation |url#https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html |access-date#2022-11-05 |website#docs.python.org |quote#stuff#['spam', 'eggs', 'lumberjack', 'knights', 'ni'] |archive-date#22 January 2021 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20210122224848/https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html |url-status#live}}</ref> A common [neologism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neologism) in the Python community is *pythonic*, which has a wide range of meanings related to program style.

##Syntax and semantics##
{{Main|Python syntax and semantics}}

Python is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use [curly brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curly_bracket_programming_language) to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) or [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)).<ref name#"AutoNT-52"/>

###Indentation###
{{Main|Python syntax and semantics#Indentation}}

Python uses [whitespace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whitespace_character) indentation, rather than [curly brackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/curly_bracket_programming_language) or keywords, to delimit [blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/block_(programming)).

Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning.

###Statements and control flow###
Python's [statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statement_(computer_science)) include:
* The [assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_(computer_science)) statement, using a single equals sign <code>#</code>
* The <code>[if](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/if-then-else)</code> statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with <code>else</code> and <code>elif</code> (a contraction of else-if)
* The <code>[for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreach#Python)</code> statement, which iterates over an *iterable* object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block
* The <code>[while](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop#Python)</code> statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true
* The <code>[try](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling_syntax#Python)</code> statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by <code>except</code> clauses (or new syntax <code>except*</code> in Python 3.11 for exception groups<ref>{{Cite web |title#8. Errors and Exceptions – Python 3.12.0a0 documentation |url#https://docs.python.org/3.11/tutorial/errors.html |access-date#2022-05-09 |website#docs.python.org |archive-date#9 May 2022 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20220509145745/https://docs.python.org/3.11/tutorial/errors.html |url-status#live}}</ref>); it also ensures that clean-up code in a <code>finally</code> block is always run regardless of how the block exits
* The <code>raise</code> statement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception
* The <code>class</code> statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a [class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/class_(computer_science)), for use in object-oriented programming
* The <code>def</code> statement, which defines a [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/function_(computing)) or [method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/method_(computing))
* The <code>[with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dispose_pattern#Language_constructs)</code> statement, which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a [lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lock_(computer_science)) before it is run, then releasing the lock; or opening and closing a [file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file)), allowing [resource-acquisition-is-initialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/resource_acquisition_is_initialization) (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom<ref>{{cite web|url#https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/highlights/|title#Highlights: Python 2.5|website#Python.org|access-date#20 March 2018|archive-date#4 August 2019|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20190804120408/https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/highlights/|url-status#live}}</ref>
* The <code>[break](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/break_statement)</code> statement, which exits a loop
* The <code>continue</code> statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next
* The <code>del</code> statement, which removes a variable—deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined
* The <code>pass</code> statement, serving as a [NOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)), syntactically needed to create an empty code block
* The <code>[assert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/assertion_(programming))</code> statement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply
* The <code>yield</code> statement, which returns a value from a [generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generator_(computer_programming)#Python) function (and also an operator); used to implement [coroutine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coroutine)s
* The <code>return</code> statement, used to return a value from a function
* The <code>[import](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/include_directive)</code> and <code>from</code> statements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program

The assignment statement (<code>#</code>) binds a name as a [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pointer_(computer_programming)) to a separate, dynamically allocated [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/object_(computer_science)). Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed [data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system); however, it always refers to *some* object with a type. This is called [dynamic typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dynamic_type)—in contrast to [statically-typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/statically-typed) languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.

Python does not support [tail call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tail_call) optimization or [first-class continuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/first-class_continuations), and, according to Van Rossum, it never will.<ref name#"AutoNT-55"/><ref name#"AutoNT-56"/> However, better support for [coroutine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coroutine)-like functionality is provided by extending Python's [generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/generator_(computer_programming)).<ref name#"AutoNT-57"/> Before 2.5, generators were [lazy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lazy_evaluation) [iterator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iterator)s; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python&nbsp;2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, it can be passed through multiple stack levels.<ref name#"AutoNT-58"/>

###Expressions###
Python's [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/expression_(computer_science)) include:
* The <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, and <code>*</code> operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python: [floor division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/floor_division) (or integer division) <code>//</code> and floating-point<code>/</code>division.<ref>{{cite web|title#division|url#https://docs.python.org|website#python.org|access-date#30 July 2014|archive-date#20 July 2006|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20060720033244/http://docs.python.org/|url-status#live}}</ref> Python uses the <code>**</code> operator for exponentiation.
* Python uses the <code>+</code> operator for string concatenation. Python uses the <code>*</code> operator for duplicating a string a specified number of times.
* The <code>@</code> infix operator<!-- was introduced in Python 3.5-->. It is intended to be used by libraries such as [NumPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy) for [matrix multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/matrix_multiplication).<ref name#PEP465>{{cite web |title#PEP 0465 – A dedicated infix operator for matrix multiplication |url#https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/ |website#python.org |access-date#1 January 2016 |archive-date#4 June 2020 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20200604224255/https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/ |url-status#live}}</ref><ref name#Python3.5Changelog>{{cite web |title#Python 3.5.1 Release and Changelog |url#https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/ |website#python.org |access-date#1 January 2016 |archive-date#14 May 2020 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20200514034938/https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-351/ |url-status#live}}</ref>
* The syntax <code>:#</code>, called the "walrus operator", was introduced in Python 3.8. It assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.<ref name#Python3.8Changelog>{{cite web |title#What's New in Python 3.8 |url#https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html |access-date#14 October 2019 |archive-date#8 June 2020 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20200608124345/https://docs.python.org/3.8/whatsnew/3.8.html |url-status#live}}</ref>
* In Python, <code>##</code> compares by value. Python's <code>is</code> operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chained—for example, {{code|lang#python|code#a <# b <# c}}.
* Python uses <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code> as Boolean operators.
* Python has a type of expression named a *[list comprehension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehension#Python)*, and a more general expression named a *[generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_(computer_programming)) expression*.<ref name#"AutoNT-59"/>
* [Anonymous function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function)s are implemented using [lambda expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_(programming)); however, there may be only one expression in each body.
* Conditional expressions are written as {{code|lang#python|code#x if c else y}}<ref name#"AutoNT-60"/> (different in order of operands from the <code>[c ? x : y](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/?:)</code> operator common to many other languages).
* Python makes a distinction between [lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_(computer_science)) and [tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tuple)s. Lists are written as {{code|lang#python|code#[1, 2, 3]}}, are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immutable) in Python). Tuples, written as {{code|lang#python|code#(1, 2, 3)}}, are immutable and thus can be used as keys of dictionaries, provided all of the tuple's elements are immutable. The <code>+</code> operator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. Thus, given the variable <code>t</code> initially equal to {{code|lang#python|code#(1, 2, 3)}}, executing {{code|lang#python|code#t # t + (4, 5)}} first evaluates {{code|lang#python|code#t + (4, 5)}}, which yields {{code|lang#python|code#(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)}}, which is then assigned back to <code>t</code>—thereby effectively "modifying the contents" of <code>t</code> while conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.<ref>{{cite web|title#4. Built-in Types – Python 3.6.3rc1 documentation|url#https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple|website#python.org|access-date#1 October 2017|archive-date#14 June 2020|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20200614194325/https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuple|url-status#live}}</ref>
* Python features *sequence unpacking* where multiple expressions, each evaluating to anything that can be assigned (to a variable, writable property, etc.) are associated in an identical manner to that forming tuple literals—and, as a whole, are put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. The statement expects an *iterable* object on the right-hand side of the equal sign that produces the same number of values as the provided writable expressions; when iterated through them, it assigns each of the produced values to the corresponding expression on the left.<ref>{{cite web|title#5.3. Tuples and Sequences – Python 3.7.1rc2 documentation|url#https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences|website#python.org|access-date#17 October 2018|archive-date#10 June 2020|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20200610050047/https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences|url-status#live}}</ref>
* Python has a "string format" operator <code>%</code> that functions analogously to <code>[printf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/printf_format_string)</code> format strings in C—e.g. {{code|2#python|1#"spam#%s eggs#%d" % ("blah", 2)}} evaluates to <code>"spam#blah eggs#2"</code>. In Python&nbsp;2.6+ and 3+, this was supplemented by the <code>format()</code> method of the <code>str</code> class, e.g. {{code|2#python|1#"spam#{0} eggs#{1}".format("blah", 2)}}. Python&nbsp;3.6 added "f-strings": {{code|2#python|1#spam # "blah"; eggs # 2; f'spam#{spam} eggs#{eggs}'}}.<ref name#"pep-0498">{{cite web |title#PEP 498 – Literal String Interpolation |url#https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/ |website#python.org |access-date#8 March 2017 |archive-date#15 June 2020 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20200615184141/https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/ |url-status#live}}</ref>
* Strings in Python can be [concatenated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/concatenation) by "adding" them (with the same operator as for adding integers and floats), e.g. {{code|2#python|1#"spam" + "eggs"}} returns <code>"spameggs"</code>. If strings contain numbers, they are added as strings rather than integers, e.g. {{code|2#python|1#"2" + "2"}} returns <code>"22"</code>.
* Python has various [string literal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/string_literal)s:
** Delimited by single or double quotes; unlike in [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell)s, [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl), and Perl-influenced languages, single and double quotes work the same. Both use the backslash (<code>\</code>) as an [escape character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/escape_character). [String interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interpolation) became available in Python&nbsp;3.6 as "formatted string literals".<ref name#"pep-0498"/>
** Triple-quoted (beginning and ending with three single or double quotes), which may span multiple lines and function like [here document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/here_document)s in shells, Perl, and [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)).
** [Raw string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_string) varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with <code>r</code>. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regular_expression)s and [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows)-style paths. (Compare "<code>@</code>-quoting" in [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)).)
* Python has [array index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/array_index) and [array slicing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/array_slicing) expressions in lists, denoted as <code>a[key]</code>, {{code|lang#python|code#a[start:stop]}} or {{code|lang#python|code#a[start:stop:step]}}. Indexes are [zero-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zero-based_numbering), and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the *start* index up to, but not including, the *stop* index. The third slice parameter, called *step* or *stride*, allows elements to be skipped and reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted—for example, {{code|lang#python|code#a[:]}} returns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a [shallow copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shallow_copy).

In Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp), [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)), or [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)). This leads to duplicating some functionality. For example:
* [List comprehensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_comprehensions) vs. <code>for</code>-loops
* [Conditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_(programming)) expressions vs. <code>if</code> blocks
* The <code>eval()</code> vs. <code>exec()</code> built-in functions (in Python&nbsp;2, <code>exec</code> is a statement); the former is for expressions, the latter is for statements

Statements cannot be a part of an expression—so list and other comprehensions or [lambda expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_(programming)), all being expressions, cannot contain statements. A particular case is that an assignment statement such as {{code|lang#python|code#a # 1}} cannot form part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement.

###Methods###
[Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(programming)) on objects are [functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/function_(programming)) attached to the object's class; the syntax {{code|lang#python|code#instance.method(argument)}} is, for normal methods and functions, [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syntactic_sugar) for {{code|lang#python|code#Class.method(instance, argument)}}. Python methods have an explicit <code>[self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/this_(computer_programming))</code> parameter to access [instance data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/instance_data), in contrast to the implicit self (or <code>this</code>) in some other object-oriented programming languages (e.g., [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++), Java, [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C), [Ruby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language))).<ref name#"AutoNT-61"/> Python also provides methods, often called *dunder methods* (due to their names beginning and ending with double-underscores), to allow user-defined classes to modify how they are handled by native operations including length, comparison, in [arithmetic operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arithmetic_operations) and type conversion.<ref>{{cite book |last1#Sweigart |first1#Al |title#Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python: Best Practices for Writing Clean Code |year#2020 |publisher#No Starch Press |isbn#978-1-59327-966-0 |page#322 |url#https://books.google.com/books?id#7GUKEAAAQBAJ&pg#PA322 |language#en |access-date#7 July 2021 |archive-date#13 August 2021 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20210813194312/https://books.google.com/books?id#7GUKEAAAQBAJ&pg#PA322 |url-status#live}}</ref>

###Typing###
[thumb|The standard type hierarchy in Python 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Python_3._The_standard_type_hierarchy-en.svg)
Python uses [duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/duck_typing) and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at [compile time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compile_time); rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that it is not of a suitable type. Despite being [dynamically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_type_checking_and_runtime_type_information), Python is [strongly typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strong_and_weak_typing), forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.

Python allows programmers to define their own types using [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/class_(computer_science)), most often used for [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/object-oriented_programming). New [instances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/object_(computer_science)) of classes are constructed by calling the class (for example, {{code|lang#python|code#SpamClass()}} or {{code|lang#python|code#EggsClass()}}), and the classes are instances of the [metaclass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metaclass) <code>type</code> (itself an instance of itself), allowing metaprogramming and [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_programming).

Before version&nbsp;3.0, Python had two kinds of classes (both using the same syntax):  *old-style* and *new-style*;<ref name#"classy"/> current Python versions only support the semantics of the new style.

Python supports [optional type annotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/optional_typing).<ref name#"type_hint-PEP"/><ref>{{Cite web |title#PEP 484 – Type Hints {{!}} peps.python.org |url#https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/ |access-date#2023-11-29 |website#peps.python.org |archive-date#27 November 2023 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20231127205023/https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/ |url-status#live}}</ref> These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors.<ref>{{cite web |title#typing — Support for type hints |url#https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html |website#Python documentation |publisher#Python Software Foundation |access-date#22 December 2023 |archive-date#21 February 2020 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20200221184042/https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html |url-status#live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url#http://mypy-lang.org/ |title#mypy – Optional Static Typing for Python |access-date#28 January 2017 |archive-date#6 June 2020 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20200606192012/http://mypy-lang.org/ |url-status#live}}</ref> Mypy also supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.<ref>{{cite web |title#Introduction |url#https://mypyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html |website#mypyc.readthedocs.io |access-date#22 December 2023 |archive-date#22 December 2023 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20231222000457/https://mypyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html |url-status#live}}</ref>

###Arithmetic operations###
Python has the usual symbols for arithmetic operators (<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>), the floor division operator <code>//</code> and the [modulo operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/modulo_operation) <code>%</code> (where the remainder can be negative,<!--unlike in C language depending on compiler,<ref>{{Cite web|url#https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11720656/modulo-operation-with-negative-numbers/42131603|title#c – Modulo operation with negative numbers|quote#Note that, in C89, whether the result round upward or downward is implementation-defined.|website#Stack Overflow|access-date#25 September 2019}}</ref>--> e.g. <code>4 % -3 ## -2</code>). It also has <code>**</code> for [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exponentiation), e.g. <code>5**3 ## 125</code> and <code>9**0.5 ## 3.0</code>, and a matrix‑multiplication operator <code>@</code> .<ref>{{cite web |url#https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/ |title#PEP 465 – A dedicated infix operator for matrix multiplication |work#python.org |access-date#3 July 2018 |archive-date#29 May 2020 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20200529200310/https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0465/ |url-status#live}}</ref> These operators work like in traditional math; with the same [precedence rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/order_of_operations), the operators [infix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) (<code>+</code> and <code>-</code> can also be [unary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unary_operation) to represent positive and negative numbers respectively).

The division between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:<ref name#"pep0238"/>
* Current Python (i.e. since 3.0) changed <code>/</code> to always be floating-point division, e.g. {{code|class#nowrap|2#python|1#5/2 ## 2.5}}.
* The floor division <code>//</code> operator was introduced. So <code>7//3 ## 2</code>, <code>-7//3 ## -3</code>, <code>7.5//3 ## 2.0</code> and <code>-7.5//3 ## -3.0</code>. Adding {{code|class#nowrap|2#python2|1#from __future__ import division}} causes a module used in Python 2.7 to use Python&nbsp;3.0 rules for division (see above).

In Python terms, <code>/</code> is *true division* (or simply *division*), and <code>//</code> is *floor division.* <code>/</code> before version 3.0 is *classic division*.<ref name#"pep0238"/>

Rounding towards negative infinity, though different from most languages, adds consistency. For instance, it means that the equation {{code|class#nowrap|2#python|1#(a + b)//b ## a//b + 1}} is always true. It also means that the equation {{code|class#nowrap|2#python|1#b*(a//b) + a%b ## a}} is valid for both positive and negative values of <code>a</code>. However, maintaining the validity of this equation means that while the result of <code>a%b</code> is, as expected, in the [half-open interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/half-open_interval) [0, *b*), where <code>b</code> is a positive integer, it has to lie in the interval (*b*, 0] when <code>b</code> is negative.<ref name#"AutoNT-62"/>

Python provides a <code>round</code> function for [rounding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rounding) a float to the nearest integer. For [tie-breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Tie-breaking), Python&nbsp;3 uses [round to even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/round_to_even): <code>round(1.5)</code> and <code>round(2.5)</code> both produce <code>2</code>.<ref name#"AutoNT-64"/> Versions before 3 used [round-away-from-zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_away_from_zero): <code>round(0.5)</code> is <code>1.0</code>, <code>round(-0.5)</code> is <code>−1.0</code>.<ref name#"AutoNT-63"/>

Python allows Boolean expressions with multiple equality relations in a manner that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression <code>a < b < c</code> tests whether <code>a</code> is less than <code>b</code> and <code>b</code> is less than <code>c</code>.<ref name#"AutoNT-65"/> C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate <code>a < b</code>, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with <code>c</code>.<ref name#"CPL"/>

Python uses [arbitrary-precision arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) for all integer operations. The <code>Decimal</code> type/class in the <code>decimal</code> module provides [decimal floating-point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decimal_floating_point) to a pre-defined arbitrary precision and several rounding modes.<ref name#"AutoNT-88"/> The <code>Fraction</code> class in the <code>fractions</code> module provides arbitrary precision for [rational number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rational_number)s.<ref>{{cite web|title#What's New in Python 2.6 |url#https://docs.python.org/2.6/whatsnew/2.6.html|website#Python v2.6.9 documentation |date#Oct 29, 2013 |access-date#26 September 2015|archive-date#23 December 2019|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20191223213856/https://docs.python.org/2.6/whatsnew/2.6.html|url-status#live}}</ref>

Due to Python's extensive mathematics library, and the third-party library [NumPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy) that further extends the native capabilities, it is frequently used as a scientific scripting language to aid in problems such as numerical data processing and manipulation.<ref>{{Cite web|url#https://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoytak/blog/whypython.html|title#10 Reasons Python Rocks for Research (And a Few Reasons it Doesn't) – Hoyt Koepke|website#University of Washington Department of Statistics |access-date#3 February 2019|archive-date#31 May 2020|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20200531211840/https://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoytak/blog/whypython.html|url-status#dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url#https://engineering.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/python.pdf|title#An introduction to Python for scientific computing|last#Shell|first#Scott|date#17 June 2014|access-date#3 February 2019|archive-date#4 February 2019|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014642/https://engineering.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/python.pdf|url-status#live}}</ref>

##Libraries##
Python's large standard library<ref name#"AutoNT-86"/> provides tools suited to many tasks and is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as [MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME) and [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) are supported. It includes modules for creating [graphical user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/graphical_user_interface)s, connecting to [relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/relational_database)s, [generating pseudorandom numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pseudorandom_number_generator), arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,<ref name#"AutoNT-88"/> manipulating [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/regular_expression)s, and [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unit_testing).

Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications—for example, the [Web Server Gateway Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface) (WSGI) implementation <code>wsgiref</code> follows PEP 333<ref name#"AutoNT-89"/>—but most are specified by their code, internal documentation, and [test suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/test_suite)s. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules need altering or rewriting for variant implementations.

{{As of|2024|03|17|post#,}} the [Python Package Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Package_Index) (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 523,000<ref name#"PyPI">{{cite web |date#2024-03-17 |title#PyPI |url#https://pypi.org/ |url-status#live |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20240317112557/https://pypi.org/ |archive-date#2024-03-17 |website#PyPI}}</ref> packages with a wide range of functionality, including:

##Development environments##
{{See also|Comparison of integrated development environments#Python}}

Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a [read–eval–print loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/read–eval–print_loop) (REPL), permitting them to function as a [command line interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/command_line_interpreter) for which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately.

Python also comes with an [Integrated development environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) called [IDLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE), which is more beginner-oriented.

Other shells, including [IDLE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLE) and [IPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython), add further abilities such as improved auto-completion, session state retention, and [syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/syntax_highlighting).

As well as standard desktop [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/integrated_development_environment)s including PyCharm, IntelliJ Idea, Visual Studio Code etc, there are [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/web_browser)-based IDEs, including [SageMath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SageMath), for developing science- and math-related programs; [PythonAnywhere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PythonAnywhere), a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and Canopy IDE, a commercial IDE emphasizing [scientific computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientific_computing).<ref>{{cite web|last1#Enthought|first1#Canopy|title#Canopy|url#https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/|website#www.enthought.com|access-date#20 August 2016|archive-date#15 July 2017|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20170715151703/https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/|url-status#dead}}</ref>

###Reference implementation###
[CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython) is the [reference implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reference_implementation) of Python. It is written in C, meeting the [C89](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C89_(C_version)) standard (Python 3.11 uses [C11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision))<ref>{{Cite web |title#PEP 7 – Style Guide for C Code {{!}} peps.python.org |url#https://peps.python.org/pep-0007/ |access-date#2022-04-28 |website#peps.python.org |archive-date#24 April 2022 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20220424202827/https://peps.python.org/pep-0007/ |url-status#live}}</ref>) with several select [C99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99) features.

###Unsupported implementations###
Other just-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:
* Google began a project named [Unladen Swallow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unladen_Swallow) in 2009, with the aim of speeding up the Python interpreter five-fold by using the [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM), and of improving its [multithreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/multithreading_(computer_architecture)) ability to scale to thousands of cores,<ref name#"AutoNT-74"/> while ordinary implementations suffer from the [global interpreter lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/global_interpreter_lock).
* [Psyco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psyco) is a discontinued [just-in-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) [specializing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/run-time_algorithm_specialization) compiler that integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain [data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/data_type)s and is faster than the standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python&nbsp;2.7 or later.
* [PyS60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyS60) was a Python&nbsp;2 interpreter for [Series 60](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_60) mobile phones released by [Nokia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia) in 2005. It implemented many of the modules from the standard library and some additional modules for integrating with the [Symbian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian) operating system. The Nokia [N900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N900) also supports Python with [GTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK) widget libraries, enabling programs to be written and run on the target device.<ref>{{cite web|title#Python on the Nokia N900|url#http://www.stochasticgeometry.ie/2010/04/29/python-on-the-nokia-n900/|website#Stochastic Geometry|date#29 April 2010|access-date#9 July 2015|archive-date#20 June 2019|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20190620000053/http://www.stochasticgeometry.ie/2010/04/29/python-on-the-nokia-n900/|url-status#live}}</ref>

###Cross-compilers to other languages###
There are several compilers/[transpiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transpiler)s to high-level object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language:

##Development##
Python's development is conducted largely through the *Python Enhancement Proposal* (PEP) process, the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions.<ref name#"PepCite000"/> Python coding style is covered in PEP&nbsp;8.<ref>{{cite web|url#https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/|title#PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code|website#Python.org|access-date#26 March 2019|archive-date#17 April 2019|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20190417223549/https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/|url-status#live}}</ref> Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.<ref name#"PepCite000"/>

Enhancement of the language corresponds with the development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues were originally discussed in the [Roundup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup_(issue_tracker)) [bug tracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bug_tracker) hosted at by the foundation.<ref name#"AutoNT-21"/> In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).<ref>{{cite web |url#https://lwn.net/Articles/885854/ |title#Moving Python's bugs to GitHub &#91;LWN.net&#93; |access-date#2 October 2022 |archive-date#2 October 2022 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20221002183818/https://lwn.net/Articles/885854/ |url-status#live}}</ref> Development originally took place on a [self-hosted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting_(web_services)) source-code repository running [Mercurial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial), until Python moved to [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) in January 2017.<ref name#py_dev_guide>{{Cite web|url#https://devguide.python.org/|title#Python Developer's Guide – Python Developer's Guide|website#devguide.python.org|access-date#17 December 2019|archive-date#9 November 2020|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20201109032501/https://devguide.python.org/|url-status#live}}</ref>

CPython's public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:
* Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and needs to be manually [ported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ported). The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently—version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. According to Guido van Rossum, a version 4.0 is very unlikely to ever happen.<ref>{{Cite web |last#Hughes |first#Owen |date#2021-05-24 |title#Programming languages: Why Python 4.0 might never arrive, according to its creator |url#https://www.techrepublic.com/article/programming-languages-why-python-4-0-will-probably-never-arrive-according-to-its-creator/ |access-date#2022-05-16 |website#TechRepublic |language#en-US |archive-date#14 July 2022 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20220714201302/https://www.techrepublic.com/article/programming-languages-why-python-4-0-will-probably-never-arrive-according-to-its-creator/ |url-status#live}}</ref>
* Major or "feature" releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Starting with Python&nbsp;3.9, these releases are expected to happen annually.<ref>{{Cite web|url#https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0602/|title#PEP 602 – Annual Release Cycle for Python|website#Python.org|language#en|access-date#6 November 2019|archive-date#14 June 2020|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20200614202755/https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0602/|url-status#live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url#https://lwn.net/Articles/802777/|title#Changing the Python release cadence [LWN.net]|website#lwn.net|access-date#6 November 2019|archive-date#6 November 2019|archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20191106170153/https://lwn.net/Articles/802777/|url-status#live}}</ref> Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release.<ref name#"release-schedule"/>
* Bugfix releases,<ref name#"AutoNT-22"/> which introduce no new features, occur about every 3 months and are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.<ref name#"AutoNT-22"/>

Many [alpha, beta, and release-candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beta_release) are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, they are often delayed if the code is not ready. Python's development team monitors the state of the code by running the large [unit test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/unit_test) suite during development.<ref name#"AutoNT-23"/>

The major [academic conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/academic_conference) on Python is [PyCon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyCon). There are also special Python mentoring programs, such as [PyLadies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyLadies).

Python 3.12 dropped some outdated modules, and more will be dropped in the future, deprecated as of 3.13; already deprecated array 'u' format code will emit <code>DeprecationWarning</code> since 3.13 and will be removed in Python 3.16. The 'w' format code should be used instead. Part of ctypes is also deprecated and <code>http.server.CGIHTTPRequestHandler</code> will emit a DeprecationWarning, and will be removed in 3.15. Using that code already has a high potential for both security and functionality bugs. Parts of the typing module are deprecated, e.g. creating a <code>typing.NamedTuple</code> class using keyword arguments to denote the fields and such (and more) will be disallowed in Python 3.15.

##API documentation generators##
Tools that can generate documentation for Python API include [pydoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pydoc) (available as part of the standard library), [Sphinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_(documentation_generator)), [Pdoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdoc) and its forks, [Doxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxygen) and [Graphviz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz), among others.<ref>{{Cite web |title#Documentation Tools |url#https://wiki.python.org/moin/DocumentationTools |access-date#2021-03-22 |website#Python.org |language#en |archive-date#11 November 2020 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20201111173635/https://wiki.python.org/moin/DocumentationTools |url-status#live}}</ref>

##Naming##
Python's name is derived from the British comedy group [Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python), whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture;<ref name#"tutorial-chapter1"/> for example, the [metasyntactic variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metasyntactic_variable)s often used in Python literature are [spam and eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(Monty_Python)) instead of the traditional [foo and bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foobar).<ref name#"tutorial-chapter1"/><ref name#"AutoNT-26"/> The official Python documentation also contains various references to Monty Python routines.<ref>{{cite book |last1#Lutz |first1#Mark |title#Learning Python: Powerful Object-Oriented Programming |year#2009 |publisher#O'Reilly Media, Inc. |isbn#9781449379322 |page#17 |url#https://books.google.com/books?id#1HxWGezDZcgC&pg#PA17 |language#en |access-date#9 May 2017 |archive-date#17 July 2017 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20170717044012/https://books.google.com/books?id#1HxWGezDZcgC&pg#PA17 |url-status#live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1#Fehily |first1#Chris |title#Python |year#2002 |publisher#Peachpit Press |isbn#9780201748840 |page#xv |url#https://books.google.com/books?id#carqdIdfVlYC&pg#PR15 |language#en |access-date#9 May 2017 |archive-date#17 July 2017 |archive-url#https://web.archive.org/web/20170717044040/https://books.google.com/books?id#carqdIdfVlYC&pg#PR15 |url-status#live}}</ref> Users of Python are sometimes referred to as "Pythonistas".<ref name#"introducing_python">{{Cite book |publisher#Sebastopol, CA : O'Reilly Media |isbn#978-1-4493-5936-2 |last#Lubanovic |first#Bill |title#Introducing Python |access-date#2023-07-31 |date#2014 |url#http://archive.org/details/introducingpytho0000luba |page#305}}</ref>

The prefix *Py-* is used to show that something is related to Python. Examples of the use of this prefix in names of Python applications or libraries include [Pygame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygame), a [binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/language_binding) of [SDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer) to Python (commonly used to create games); [PyQt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyQt) and [PyGTK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyGTK), which bind [Qt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software)) and GTK to Python respectively; and [PyPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyPy), a Python implementation originally written in Python.

##Popularity##

The combination of Python and [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) has proved to be particularly useful for AI applications, with Prolog providing knowledge representation and reasoning capablities. The Janus system, in particular, exploits the similarites between these two languages,
in part because of their use of dynamic typing, and the simple recursive nature of their
data structures. Typical applications of this combination include  natural language processing, visual query
answering, geospatial reasoning, and handling of semantic web data.<ref>Andersen, C. and Swift, T., 2023. The Janus System: a bridge to new prolog applications.

##Further reading##
<!-- THIS IS *NOT* A LIST OF ALL PYTHON BOOKS
According to [[Wikipedia:Further reading]], criteria for inclusion includes:
1. Should clearly qualify as WP:RS, as indicated by reviews and citations to it.
...
5. There should be guidelines on limiting the number of sources.
6. To avoid spam, any book included should have received more than one good review in RS: newspapers and scholarly journals being the norm, and the clear balance of RS reviews should be positive. This would avoid self-publish spamming, POV pushing, and attempts by publishers to get books promoted through inclusion on Wikipedia. At the moment "editorial recommendations" as described in the manual smacks of OR.
7. Neutrality on the part of editors is essential. In terms of major debates, items representing all major positions should be included, with annotations indicating the specific POV of each. We may have to work out rules where topic disputes are irreconcilable.
